The goal of the project was to determine which factors are most important in making film revenues, and how each factor might contribute differently in driving film revenue. 

To start this project, I scrapped the data from boxofficemojo.com w/ following columns - title, domestic total gross, int'l total gross, worldwide total gross, opening domestic, budget, runtime, and release date. 
By looking at the pairplot for movie data, I could see how some factors predict movie's sucess as measured by worldwide total gross. To explore the relationship, I could compare movie budget vs domestic gross.


Each pairplot shows the relationship, and while budget may be the important factor in driving film revenus, there many other things to consider.
