The goal of this project was to determine which factors are most important in bringing the movie's revenues, and how each factor might contribute differently in driving the film's revenue. 

To start this project, I scrapped the data from boxofficemojo.com w/ following columns - title, domestic total gross, int'l total gross, worldwide total gross, opening domestic, budget, runtime, and release date. 
By looking at the pairplot for the movie data, I could analyze how some factors can predict a movie's sucess measured by worldwide total gross. To explore the relationships, I could start compare movie budget vs domestic gross.


Each pairplot shows the relationship, and while budget may be the important factor in driving film revenus, there many other things to consider.
