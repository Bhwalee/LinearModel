# Linear Regression

Summary:
Using data scraped from a website, build linear regression models that address a useful prediction and/or interpretation problem in any domain of interest such as movies or sports. Communicate your process and findings in a 5 minute presentation (to the entire class at the end of week 2) and a short written description.

Metis projects are broken down into 5 component parts -- design, data, algorithms, tools, and communication -- that are each scored individually. Below is a description of each component as it relates to this project. For more detail on how these components are graded and how extra points are rewarded, refer to the project success guide.
