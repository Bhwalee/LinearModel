For linear regression project, I would like to predict the movie's success by analyzing different subset of features. 

Using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, I would scrape movie data from IMDB.com and boxofficemojo.com to gather a data that contains at least 1,000+ rows of movies with different features as much as 10+. Some features might include different types of genres, running time, age group, budget...etc. 

Data exploration on the movie data will show which kind of genres is popular and analyze MPAA scores by categorizing. 

In the end, I hope to find out what factors influence the movie's success and which factors have the most impact brining the most revenue.
