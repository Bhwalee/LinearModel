For linear regression project, I would like to predict the movie's success by determining the movie's score. 

Using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, I would scrape movie data from IMDB.com and boxofficemojo.com to gather a data that contains at least 1,000+ rows of movies with different features as much as 10+. Some features might include different types of genres, running time, age group, budget...etc. 

To start, data exploration on movie data will show which kind of genre is popular and analyze MPAA scores by category accordingly. 

By end, I hope to find what factors influence movie's success and which factors affect movie score as a result.
