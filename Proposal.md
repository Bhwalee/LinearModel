For linear regression project, I would like to predict the movie's success by determining the movie's score. 

Using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, I would scrape movie data from IMDB.com and boxofficemojo.com to gather a data that contains at least 1,000+ rows of movies with different features as much as 10+.

To start, doing data exploration on movie data will show which kind of genre is popular as well as MPAA scores accordingly by category. 

By end, I hope to find what factors influence movie's success and which factors affect movie score as a result.
